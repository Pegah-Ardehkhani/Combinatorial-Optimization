# Heuristic methods

Heuristic methods for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** are designed to find good (often near-optimal) solutions in a reasonable amount of time, especially for larger problem instances where exact algorithms become impractical. Unlike exact methods, heuristics do not guarantee an optimal solution but often achieve high-quality solutions efficiently. These methods can be broadly categorized into **constructive heuristics** and **improvement heuristics (local search)**, as well as **metaheuristics**.

### 1. Constructive Heuristics
Constructive heuristics build a feasible solution from scratch by adding one city at a time, following a specific rule or heuristic. Common examples include:

- **Nearest Neighbor (NN) Heuristic**:
  - Starts from an arbitrary city and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited city until all cities are visited.
  - **Reference**: Original methods described in classic TSP and combinatorial optimization books (no specific "paper" attributed to NN for TSP).
  
- **Nearest Insertion and Farthest Insertion Heuristics**:
  - In **Nearest Insertion**, begin with a small sub-tour and repeatedly insert the nearest unvisited city in the most cost-effective position.
  - In **Farthest Insertion**, insert the farthest unvisited city instead.

- **Christofides Algorithm**:
  - Specifically for metric TSP (satisfies triangle inequality), it combines Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), minimum matching, and Eulerian path algorithms.
  - Guarantees a solution within a factor of 1.5 of the optimal solution.

### 2. Improvement Heuristics (Local Search)
Improvement heuristics start with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improve it by making small modifications. Common techniques include:

- **2-opt and 3-opt Heuristics**:
  - **2-opt** removes two edges and reconnects them in a different way to reduce the tour length.
  - **3-opt** removes three edges and reconnects the segments differently to explore additional solutions.

- **Lin-Kernighan Heuristic**:
  - An extension of the k-opt algorithm that dynamically determines the value of \( k \) based on each move.
  - Often considered the best heuristic for TSP, providing near-optimal solutions for large instances.
